Spring Cloud Data Flow is an open-source toolkit that can deploy streaming and batch data pipelines on <%= vars.scdf_platform %> (see the [project home page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow)). The data pipelines are composed of [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream) or [Spring Cloud Task](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-task) applications. A streaming pipeline DSL makes it easy to specify which apps to deploy and how to connect outputs and inputs. The composed task DSL is useful for when a series of task apps must be run as a directed graph.

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides REST APIs for composing and deploying data pipelines programmatically. It also provides a dashboard that includes a graphical pipeline editor for building new pipelines interactively, as well as views of deployable apps and running apps with metrics using Prometheus, InfluxDB, or other monitoring systems. Spring Cloud Data Flow also includes a shell application for working with the API from the command line.
